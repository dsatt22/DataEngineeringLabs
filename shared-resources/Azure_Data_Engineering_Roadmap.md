# 📘 Azure Data Engineering Learning Roadmap (Based on DP-203)

This roadmap defines the skills and topics we’ll cover as we progress from beginner projects to advanced Azure pipelines.

---

## Beginner Projects (Local Environment)
- Build pipelines with Python, Pandas, pyodbc, SQL Server
- Create, clean, and load data from CSV/Excel to SQL
- Use Power BI for visualizations
- Document projects with README and GitHub

---

## Intermediate Projects (Cloud Integration)
- Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database
- Azure Data Factory for ingestion pipelines
- Partitioning, schema design, incremental loads
- Power BI with cloud datasets

---

## Advanced Projects (DP-203 Core)
- Synapse Analytics, Azure Data Factory, Databricks
- Batch + Streaming (Event Hubs, Stream Analytics)
- Lakehouse / star schema / PolyBase
- Handling schema drift, deduplication

---

## Security & Monitoring
- Encryption in-transit and at-rest
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Row-level / column-level security
- Monitoring with Azure Monitor & Log Analytics
- Performance tuning and scaling

---

## Learning Flow
1. Multiple beginner projects to master local ETL pipelines
2. Intermediate Azure projects
3. Advanced pipelines aligned with DP-203
4. Security and monitoring enhancements
